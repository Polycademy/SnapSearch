                        <p>Snapsearch is a search engine optimisation (SEO) and robot proxy for complex front-end javascript & AJAX enabled (potentially realtime) HTML5 web applications.</p>
                        <p>Search engines like <a href="https://developers.google.com/webmasters/ajax-crawling/" target="_blank" title="Google's AJAX Crawling Specification">Google's crawler and HTTP scrapers such as Facebook's image extraction robot cannot execute complex javascript applications</a>. This include websites using javascript frameworks such as AngularJS, EmberJS, KnockoutJS, Backbone.js, jQuery, Meteor and much more.</p>
                        <p>Snapsearch's middleware detects and intercepts requests made by search engines, then sends its own javascript enabled scrapers to cache a snapshot of your web page. The snapshot is seamlessly and transparently passed back to the search engine through your web application. This <a href="https://developers.google.com/webmasters/ajax-crawling/docs/html-snapshot" target="_blank" title="Google's Suggested Snapshot Method for AJAX Sites">method is supported by Google</a> so you're not in violation of any rules.</p>
                        <p>Snapsearch powered by Mozilla Firefox instances. Theses browsers are kept up to date with the <strong>rapid 6 week release cycles from Mozilla</strong>. We'll always be able to serve the latest in HTML5 technology. This is an advantage over using something like PhantomJS which is affected by the slower and spurious QtWebKit engine development cycle.</p>

This javascript string is evaled on the page after all asynchronous requests have finished but prior to the capture of the page contents. This allows you to do DOM mutations or capture specific content such as extracting links which will be returned as a string independent of the page capture. <strong>You can assume this string is executed in the context of an anonymous function.</strong> So you can just write <code>return 'hello world';</code> and it will just work. Returning string values is recommended. A rule of thumb is that if the desired result it can be serialized into JSON, then it can be returned. DOM node objects cannot be serialized and returned, you must first convert them to textual strings. These returned values will be stored in the <code>callbackResult</code> property in the response.</dd>

                        <p>SnapSearch officially supports and provides PHP, Ruby, Node.js and Python middleware. All middleware are framework agnostic, and should be able to work within a middleware framework or without.</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><a href="https://github.com/SnapSearch/SnapSearch-Client-PHP">PHP</a> - 1.1.0</li>
                            <li><a href="https://github.com/SnapSearch/SnapSearch-Client-Ruby">Ruby</a> - 1.0.0</li>
                            <li><a href="https://github.com/SnapSearch/SnapSearch-Client-Node">Node.js</a> - 0.0.2</li>
                            <li><a href="https://github.com/SnapSearch/SnapSearch-Client-Python">Python</a> - 0.0.7</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>These libraries first automatically detect if an HTTP request comes from a search engine or robot. If it is indeed a search engine, it sends an HTTP POST request to <code>https://snapsearch.io/api/v1/robot</code> passing in parameters configuring how SnapSearch's robot should extract your content. SnapSearch will then send a HTTP GET request to the same URL and return the HTTP response (status code, headers and content) as a JSON response to the library. The client library then returns that data back to your application. You will have to select which data to present to the search engine. It is recommended to return the status code and content but not all of the headers, due to potential header mismatch with content encoding. However if you have specific headers that are important, then first test if it works with a simple HTTP client before deploying it.</p>
                        <p>All of the middleware are open source, and we welcome pull requests for patches or new middleware implementations. Check out our <a href="https://github.com/SnapSearch/">Github organisation</a> for more.</p>

                        <h4>Hashbang Urls</h4>
                        <p>Make sure you are using hash bang urls and not just hash urls. This fits with <a href="https://developers.google.com/webmasters/ajax-crawling/docs/specification">Google's AJAX Crawling Scheme</a>. It makes it easier to identify what is a hash, and what is meant to be path. Remember hash fragments are never passed to the server. The middleware needs to know the full HTTP url or else it won't know where to scrape. This means you will need to rely on the search engine robots to convert hash bang urls to query fragment urls. <strong>This meta tag will need to be on every page: <code>&lt;meta name=&quot;fragment&quot; content=&quot;!&quot; /&gt;</code></strong>. If you are using HTML 5 push state urls, the meta tag is still a good practice as it allows search engines following the AJAX specification to know that your site is a single page application.</p>
                        <h4>Dealing with non-HTML resources</h4>
                        <p>You need to make sure that non-HTML resources are not intercepted by SnapSearch. Non-HTML resources refer to:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Static files that are served through your application and not through an HTTP server such as NGINX or Apache.</li>
                            <li>Downloads that served through an application level controller.</li>
                            <li>Text data interchange formats that are not meant to be used for the end user's browser. For example: JSON, XML, RSS... etc.</li>
                            <li>API resources that don't display the front end site, but are there for interaction between machines.</li>
                            <li>Any connections that do not go through the HTTP protocol.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>You can prevent SnapSearch from intercepting these non-HTML resources by:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Setup an array of whitelisted regular expression routes which will be matched against the request URL. SnapSearch will not intercept any routes that are not on the whitelist.</li>
                            <li>Setup an array of blacklisted regular expression routes which will be matched against the request URL. SnapSearch will not intercept any routes that are on the blacklist.</li>
                            <li>SnapSearch middleware can optionally check if the URL path has an invalid file extension. Some extensions are valid for HTML resources such as <code>.html</code>, but others such as <code>.js</code> are not. Our middleware has an option to switch on this detection and it will ignore requests that go invalid extensions. It is left off by default due to possible confusion.</li>
                            <li>In MVC style applications, you may have a single controller which is responsible for displaying the front end code. If you execute our clients inside that particular controller, then you will not have any problems with non-HTML resources, since it can only intercept requests that go to the front end.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h4>SSL issues</h4>
                        <p>SnapSearch will not be able to capture from sites that have invalid SSL certificates (this means self-signed SSL certificates as well). Make sure your SSL is a valid certificate that will work in a normal browser before using SnapSearch.</p>
                        <h4>Ensuring Analytics Works with Snapsearch</h4>
                        <p>When Snapsearch visits your site, it will come with a UserAgent containing "SnapSearch". You can however configure this to your own liking. Use this user agent in order to filter out our requests when using web analytics.</p>
                        <h4>Large content</h4>
                        <p>SnapSearch middleware will timeout the request if the initial request to your site and its synchronous resources takes longer than 30 seconds.</p>
                        <h4>Soft 404s</h4>
                        <p>Soft 404s should be avoided. The final representation to the search engine should be exactly the same as normal user with a normal browser would see. However you can achieve this by using the special meta tags and switching <code>meta</code> request parameter to true.</p>
                        <h4>Flash Support</h4>
                        <p>Our robots can support flash. At this moment the flash plugin is not installed. However we are going to be adding this feature soon. Note that flash movies will not appear on any screenshots.</p>
                        <h4>Supporting JS disabled Browsers</h4>
                        <p>It's not possible to detect if the HTTP client supports Javascript on the first page load. Therefore you have to know the user agents beforehand. A workaround involves the HTML Meta Refresh tag. You set an HTML meta refresh tag which will refresh the browser and point it to the same url but with query parameter indicating to the server that the client doesn't run javascript. This meta refresh tag can be then be cancelled using javascript. Another approach would be to use the Noscript tag and place the meta refresh tag there. None of these methods are guaranteed to work. but if you're interested check out: <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/q/3252743/582917">http://stackoverflow.com/q/3252743/582917</a></p>
